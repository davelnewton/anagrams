# Anagrams

 Anagram exercise taken from [code kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata06-anagrams/)

Given a file containing one word per line, print out all the combinations of words that are anagrams - each line in the output contains all the words from the input that are anagrams of each other. For example, your program might include in its output:
```
  kinship pinkish
  enlist inlets listen silent
  boaster boaters borates
  fresher refresh
  sinks skins
  knits stink
  rots sort
```

### Usage
While sitting in the project root, run: 
```
ruby anagram_file test_file.txt
```

### Todo List
* refactor to use instantiated class
* find the longest words that are anagrams
* find the set of anagrams containing the most words
